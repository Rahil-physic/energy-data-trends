# Global Energy Trends: Fossil vs Low-Carbon (1900–2023)


## 🌍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze historical global energy production and consumption trends, with a focus on:
- How fossil and renewable energy sources have evolved over time.
- Which countries consume the most energy.
- How fast low-carbon energy is growing worldwide.



## 📊 Key Insights
- Fossil fuels still dominate total global energy production.
- Low-carbon sources show steady growth, particularly after 2000.
- Energy consumption is concentrated in a few major economies (China, USA, India).
